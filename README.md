# 🏠 Airbnb Clone - Property Rental Platform

Airbnb clone with modern UI/UX, user authentication, and property management capabilities. Built to demonstrate production-level frontend development skills with attention to detail in design and user experience.

> **Note:** This project prioritizes UI/UX design excellence and frontend implementation. While it includes authentication and basic property listing functionality, it's primarily built to showcase design skills, responsive layouts, and smooth user interactions rather than complete backend functionality.
